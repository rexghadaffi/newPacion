						<h3><span>History</span></h3>

						<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>STI's commitment to establishing a lifelong relationship with its graduates has brought forth the inception of the STI Alumni Association, Inc. (STIAA).</strong></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>STIAA is a non-stock, non-profit organization duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. It was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 1999 after top management approved its formal creation.</strong></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The first STIAA office was located at Montepino Building in Makati City and the establishment of which is attributed to the organization effort of the following pioneer officers:</strong></p>
						<ul style="text-align: justify;">
						<li><strong>President: Alfred P. Martinez</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Vice-President: Ferdie B. Balcita</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Secretary: Rosell L. Villariba</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Treasurer in Trust: Eddie V. Musico</strong></li>
						<li><strong>PRO: Leonardo A. Adaptante</strong></li>
					    </ul>
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Through annual membership dues, STIAA is able to conduct various activities for the benefit of its members. In fact, this is what makes our association distinct. It exists not for the institution but rather for its members. STIAA management tries to ensure that each and every program must have a positive result for the members. On the average, nine thousand (9,000) STI graduates in a year are added to our membership list.</strong></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The STI Alumni Association, Inc. is guided by the Board of Trustees and overseen by an Executive Director.</strong></p>
